#README OCTAVE GENERATOR
The (un)official generator of READMEs in Octave/MATLAB.  
To run, simply download and unzip the package.  
In the main directory, run GenerateReadme.m and the files will be visible in the output directory.  
To change the properties of the READMEs, edit the parameters at the top of GenerateReadme.m before running the script.  Have fun!
