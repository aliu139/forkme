# Introduction
In a perfect world, every repository on GitHub would have a clear README, capable of letting visitors know about the purpose, usages, and history behind a project. However, writing a consise yet comprehensive README is an art that takes time and thought. ForkMe is our attempt at disrupting the current ecosystem of READMEs, by automating the process! Even if you aren't familiar with the newest startup jargon, let our product revolutionize the way that you document your product.
